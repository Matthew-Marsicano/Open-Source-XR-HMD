# Open-Source-XR-HMD
Creators: Tyler Myers, Matthew Marsicano

## An open-source Head Mounted Display built for EECE5698 Networked XR Systems. 

As the final project for our technical elective, Networked XR Systems, we set out to develop an acessible, affordable, and open source XR platform using the concepts explored in our coursework. By using a Raspberry Pi, our hardware suite is compatible with a wide range of mature sensors, and peripherals.
